# Durham, March 2014

Public OOD class.

## Setup

Clone this repository:

```bash
$ git glone https://github.com/torqueforge/durham-2014-march.git
```

Change directories so that you are in the project:

```bash
$ cd durham-2014-march
```

Install `bundler` if you don't have it:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Each exercise will be in its own subdirectory. `cd` into that subdirectory.
There will be a `Rakefile`, and you can run `rake` to run the tests.
